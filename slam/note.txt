Past, Present, and Future of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping: Toward the
Robust-Perception Age

    ----front-end:
	|	feature extraction 
[]--|	feature tracking/loop closure / data association
	|		^
	|		|
	----back-end:
	   	MAP-estimation
		EKF

		back-end feedback info to front-end for verifying loop closure.
		sensor-dependent SLAM front end,
		front-end's preprocessing that happens in the front end is depend on
		input data stream

robust performance:
	low failure
high-level understanding:
	
task-driven perception:
	the SLAM system is able to select relevant perceptual information and 
	filter out irrelevant sensor data, in order to support the task, the robot has to perform

when noise model is unknown: 
	NO EKF!
	But U can use M-estimate or adaptive estimator.
